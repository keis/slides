# Building a testing platform with mesos

???

Share some of the findings of our research into running mesos.

Initially focused on building a platform for doing builds and running tests

---

# Problems with VMs

Maintaining them

Don't start fast enough

Cloud provider APIs are all different

Resource utilisation


???

maintaining vms even though container

start

# What is Apache Mesos?

![mesos](assets/mesos.png)


???

Before we get into it

---

An open source cluster manager
???
apache foundation

Keeps track of the resources in your cluster

Combining several resource to a single resource pool.

Like one big operating system
--
 that does resource isolation
???
Keeps resources isolated using containers

either using docker or a builtin containeriser

Isolated view of the fs, network etc

Makes sure you get the cpu and memory you asked for
--
 and sharing for your distributed system
???

and resource sharing

You provide tasks to run and mesos schedules them to run somewhere on your cluster

A mix of containers running on the same host


---

# Cluster management

Allocate the resources you need

Free resources when done

???

cluster management is key concept

Allocate resources with smaller granularity. on cpu shares, memory in MB, workers

Number of task or containers rather than number of VMs

No need to spend a lot of time managing VMs or scripting your infrastructure by
separating these responsibilities. And having a platform to build on.

Avoiding static allocation get better utilisation

---

# Why Mesos?

???
Mesos is not the only thing out there, kubernetes, swarm, nomad. So why mesos?

--
Established
???
Mesos has been around for a while, top level apache, being in production for years.

--


Used in production at big scale

???

Used by some big players
* twitter, full
* apple, siri
* netflix
* ebay

--

Flexible
???
Very flexible and supports all kinds of work flows. tasks and web services


---

# Container native

Scaling unit is a container

Free from the machines

Not limited to docker

???

As a developer, you don't deal with machines. even virtual
---

class: center middle
# Basic terminology

---

# Task

One process, short lived or long running, a job

???

job, process, task

no vm, containerised process

start and end

---

# Frameworks

A two tiered scheduler

Mesos for the low level plumbing

One or more frameworks on top

Work flow implementation


???

# How does it work

* a two tiered system, mesos and so called frameworks
* mesos low level, the scheduler
* The frameworks on top is what you as a user would interface with
* Multiple frameworks available and you can write your own

---

![architecture](assets/arch2.png)

???

* Highly available master, stand by, replicated data
* mesos master tracks resources and *offers* them to the frameworks
    - scheduler
* framework decide what if anything to run on those resources. complex or simple logic.
    - redundant instances on different hosts
    - launch task based on various triggers
* mesos hands task over to slave and reports back status of the process
* Zookeeper for coordination, for the layers to find each other
* Each task is containerised


---

# Short lived jobs

Task oriented

e.g Chronos, Jenkins

scheduling, re-try, workers

???

Chronos, cron job like

Jenkins, starting worker agents based on queue

Spikes in work load, needs to scale quickly

No work, no tasks running on the cluster


---

# Long running processes

As a platform for services

e.g Marathon, Aurora, Kubernetes

restart, health check, rolling upgrade

???

Different frameworks for different use cases

Web service, redundant instances

Marathon by mesosphere

Kubernetes by google

Aurora by twitter, Apache Software Foundation

Specialised for running kafka, mysql etc

Keeping a desired number of instances

restarting if dead, health check, rolling upgrades


---

# Mesos - Recap

???

A quick recap

--

Flexibility from frameworks

???

All kind of use cases and work flows

--

Battle proven core

???

It's used in production to do real things

--

Containers!

???

Containers is at the core

If you can put it in a container you can run it on mesos


# questions

class: center middle
# Jenkins at Klarna

---

# Jenkins at Klarna
~30 teams, ~1k commits / day

1 jenkins master and X slaves for each team

VM-Based infrastructure

Each push triggers multiple jobs

Already using containers

???

30 teams, 1k commits / day

1 master, x slaves

Slow start so teams try to have VMs always on, so

idle workers and still a backlog when we have a spike

Everytime we push a lot of things happen

Each step of the job is typically consist of running a command in a container


---

# Working with VMs

Maintenance

Slow to start [minutes]

Static resource

Already using containers

???

This is where we are at, we're working with VMs

Abstracting the hardware

Maintenance on each team

networking, System updates etc but no cables

full init process

Static in practice, On the scale of hours/day

People don't want to deal with that to much, so they build container images


---

# Working with containers

Quick to start [seconds]

Dynamic resource

Already building them

???

Another layer of abstraction, Abstracting the Execution Environment

Feels like instant to start, assuming you have the image

Dynamic resource, dispose when done. On the scale of minutes.

Removes containers after they are done. And we can do garbage collection of images.

Used in development process, run on their laptops


---

# Jenkins on mesos

Plugin makes jenkins a mesos framework

Agent launched in container

![mesos-jenkins](assets/mesos-jenkins.png)

???

# One of the things we're looking into

Jenkins becomes a framework, and is talking to the mesos masters

When there is something in the build queue it will try to launch Jenkins agent in a container on a mesos slave

Killed after a short time out, 3 minutes, with no jobs. And resources returned!

Compared to bringing up a new VM on demand it's great. That was about 5-8
minutes while this is only about ~20 seconds

And even less if the image is already on the host

Better resource utilisation and a team that suddenly needs more executors can
easily scale up

---

class: center wide
![jenkins](assets/jenkins.png)


???

Adding job to queue

Agent being started but not up yet

Agent starts running job

up top we see the task, running the agent, on the mesos master ui

one executor per agent, because scaling to more agent is super easy

---

class: center middle
# But we can do better

#What if we run each task directly on mesos

---

Launching tasks directly on mesos

![eremetic](assets/eremetic.png)

Runs One-Off tasks with no upfront configuration

???

Developed at Klarna as part of our mesos Proof of concept

Simple api to launch tasks, launch task in a single step with a POST

And check the status of task later

Written in go, and surprisingly easy to do

Like lambda


---

![eremetic-post](assets/eremetic-post.png)

???

The smallest possible request

the command to run, a simple hello world

the name of the docker image to run in

resources needed to run this task. cpu and mem

It's also possible to add volume mounts and environment variables

response is the mesos task id, which can be used throughout the mesos stack.
It's also added to the environment of the container


---

![eremetic-post](assets/eremetic-get.png)

???

At some later time we can check in on the task

It reminds us what we asked to run along with some other details

timestamps of the states it goes through

staging includes pulling the image of the container

running timestamp is from when it actually started executing

and finally the terminating status, which could also be failed if we get a bad exit code


---

And we have the logs to prove it

![eremetic-post](assets/eremetic-kibana.png)

???

it is kibana

logspout with a slightly adapted logstash adapter
adding the task id the json blob so we can search for it

Which is the reason we want to add it to environment config


---

# Hello World at scale

![lgtm](assets/got.gif)


???

# Hello world is not the most interesting

But we've have done something actually useful

---

# System test

Jenkins jobs to run group of rspec tests

Currently ~10 in parallel
???

Together with the system test team

tests written in rspec, that test the REST apis

Replacing a whole lot of Jenkins Job Builder Magic that is used to create jobs for supporting parallel runs

static division, adding more tests means adding more jobs when some groups become to big. Handcrafted jobs.

About 10 parallel jobs

---

Finding list of scenarios to run

```ruby
json_file = Tempfile.new('spec_files.json')
system("rspec --dry-run -f j spec -o #{json_file.path}")
dry_run_output = JSON.parse(File.read json_file.path)
system("rm -fr #{json_file.path}")

# Get all unique spec files
spec_list = dry_run_output['examples'].map { |h| h['file_path'] }.uniq

File.open("#{env}-#{country}.csv", 'w') do |f|
  files = ''
  spec_list.each { |file| files &lt;&lt; (file.sub './spec/scenarios/', '') + ',' }
  f.write(files)
end

```

???

Does a rspec dry run to find all scenarios to run

and builds this list as artifact

The set of scenarios to run varies with target market etc

---

Launching scenarios on mesos

```ruby
run_scenarios = File.foreach("#{env}-#{country}.csv").first.split(',')
run_scenarios.each do |file|
  folder, filename = file.split('/')
  body = {
    docker_image: "hub.int.klarna.net/systest-ruby-el7:#{docker_vsn}",
    command: "/bin/bash -l -c \"bundle exec rake t['PROD','#{folder}',"
      "'#{filename}','#{env}','#{country}']\"",
    task_cpus: 0.1,
    task_mem: 200.0
  }
```
???
Loops through the list of scenarios to run from the previous step and construct a payload describing the task

* docker image
* the rake command to run
* cpus and mem

--

```ruby
  run_scenario = conn.post do |req|
    req.url '/task'
    req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    req.body = body.to_json
  end

  scenarios["#{folder}: #{filename}"] = run_scenario.env
    .response_headers['location']
end
```
???
 .. and POST a task to eremetic

30 separate tasks depending on target country

---

```ruby
60.times do
  sleep 10
  scenarios.each do |scenario, location|
    execution_result = conn.get "#{location}"
    ...
    scenarios.delete(scenario) if
      %{'TASK_FINISHED'}.include? task_status['status']
    scenarios.delete(scenario) if
      %{'TASK_FAILED', 'TASK_ERROR', 'TASK_LOST', 'TASK_KILLED'}
        .include? task_status['status']
  end
  break if scenarios.empty?
end

```

???

And then we poll the scenarios until we get FINISHED or FAILED

Total run is duration of longest task. No need to balance jobs

---

# Using mesos for CD

???

Don't deal with VM

That's IT!

--

Scales out quickly when you need it

--

Cleans up when you're done

--

Option for custom solution if needed

--

Abstracting the infrastructure

--

Cloud agnostic

--

Efficient resource utilisation
